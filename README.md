### Notification System
Redis-backed notification queue

Reminders sent to facilitators who haven't submitted weekly logs.

Alerts sent to managers on submission or missed deadlines.

Background worker script: backgroundWorker.js

Run background worker:
```sh
node backgroundWorker.js
```
### Assumptions
Roles are either manager, facilitator or students, and protected routes are accessed via JWT tokens.

A facilitator can only view/update/delete their own logs.

### Running Tests
```sh
npm test
```
Tests are written using Jest and Supertest.

### Future Enhancements
Add pagination, search & filters to all endpoints.

Full email and push notification integration.

Admin dashboard for managers.

UI frontend using React or another JS framework.
